# Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
- [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation) is a prompting technique that supplies domain-relevant data as context to produce responses based on that data and the prompt.
- It modifies interactions with a [large language model (LLM)](../Foundational-Models/LLM.md) so that the model responds to user queries with reference to a specified set of documents, using this information in preference to information drawn from its own vast, static training data.
