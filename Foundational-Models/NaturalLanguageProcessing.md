# Natural language processing (NLP)
- [NLP](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/nlp/) is a [machine learning technology](MachineLearning.md) that gives machines the ability to interpret and manipulate human language. 
- NLP does this by analyzing the data, intent, or sentiment in the message and responding to human communication.
- Typically, NLP implementation begins by gathering and preparing unstructured text or speech data from different sources and processing the data. 
- It uses techniques such as tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, stop word removal, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, speech recognition, sentiment analysis, and so on. 
- However, modern LLMs don't require using these intermediate steps.
