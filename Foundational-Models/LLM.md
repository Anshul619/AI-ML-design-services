# Model hosting

## Cloud hosed models
- [Hugging face](https://huggingface.co/) servers (Saas based) - unreliable, intermittent

## Self hosting models on cloud server
- Expensive - min 40K per month - [NVidia GPU server](https://www.e2enetworks.com/products/hgx-h100-cloud-gpu)
- Roughly break even on 1 billion interfaces/models

# Dimensions
- Response time can be decreased by increasing server capacity
- Accuracy can be improved with more tunning of the model

# Top models
