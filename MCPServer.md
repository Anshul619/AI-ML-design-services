# MCP Server
- [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro) is an open standard—like a universal interface—that enables [large language models (LLMs)](Foundational-Models/LLM.md) to access tools, data, or external services through a standardized protocol. 
- It solves the problem of having to build bespoke integrations for each LLM-tool pair, simplifying the “N×M” integration challenge. and supports transports like **stdio (local)** and **HTTP** or **HTTP+SSE (remote)** using **JSON-RPC** under the hood
